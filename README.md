 Project to be done in teams of 2 people (your team: SOUFIANE OUMALEK OUMALEK)
 Project will start Mar 7, 2024 4:00 AM, must end by Mar 14, 2024 3:00 AM
 Checker was released at Mar 8, 2024 10:00 PM
 Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done with the project)
 An auto review will be launched at the deadline
This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

User authentication via a token
List all files
Upload a new file
Change permission of a file
View a file
Generate thumbnails for images
You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be your friend)

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.

Enjoy!
